First of all you need to have `node` and `yarn`(or `npm`) installed on your machine.

_If you decide to use npm don't forget to delete yarn.lock in folders_

Press the `Use this template` button on Github and create your own repository.

Clone your repo to your local machine.

1. `git clone https://github.com/neuralmed/template-react-javascript`
2. `cd template-react-javascript`
3. `yarn` or `npm install`
4. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

To run the tests, after the dependencies are installed, run `yarn test`.

`yarn test` to keep testing observing changes.

`yarn coverage` to generate the test coverage report in the files.
